Running the Project

To start your crew of AI agents and execute tasks:

crewai run


This initializes the financial_researcher Crew, assembling the agents and assigning tasks as defined in your configuration. By default, it generates a report.md file in the root folder with a research output on LLMs.

Understanding Your Crew

The financial_researcher Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. Agents collaborate on tasks defined in config/tasks.yaml, leveraging their collective skills. Agent configurations are outlined in config/agents.yaml.
